File: Recount2_Gtex_Heart_metadata_map.tsv 
This file contains the metadata for GTEx and embryonic heart. It is assuming that embryonic heart samples are tagged at the end. I also had to edit this file manually by adding in four tissue designations because they were missing from the original file provided by Recount2.

File Gini_Score.R
File contains scripts to calculate gini score from counts matrix. 
Functions should be used in the following order:
tissue_colval()
Gets list of indexes for each tissue type.
Tissue_Average()
Calculates average counts for each tissue type.
Tissue_max()
Gives gene a tissue designation based on maximum count.
GeneGini()
Calculates gini score for each gene.

File gene2gini.Rdata
Dataframe containing the gini scores for each gene, along with their ensembl indentifier and gene symbol, and their tissue designation.

File gene2gini.Rdata
tsv file containing the dataframe in gene2gini.Rdata. This is the file used for Supplementary Table S5 in the human embryonic heart paper.

File boxplot_data.Rdata
File contains dataframe used to plot Figure 6B in the paper.
